GoLang:

* GoLang is complied programming language
* Go tool can run file directly, without VM like JVM for Java
* Go can be used to build System apps to web apps - cloud
* Go is already in production and many companies are using it like startups, Google, Uber etc.
* Go is really fast compared to Java / Python
* Go helps in reducing the servers size like if Java uses 6 machines then Go can reduce to 2 machines
* Go is kind of Yes and No for object oriented, it does not have method overloading / overriding, classes, methods. It has structs which is similar to classes in Java, what you see on the screen is the code i.e, its a straight language.
* Go does not have try catch, and it does not need it too, lexer does a lot of work for Go
* No Semicolons


Types:
* Go is case inSensitive almost
* variable type should be known in advance
* Everything is Type like in javascript everything is object
* String, Bool, Integer, Floating and Complex
* Array, Slices, Maps, Structs and Pointers


Build:
* command to build windows exe file : GOOS="windows" go build

Memory management: https://pkg.go.dev/runtime
* Memory allocation and de-allocation happens automatically in GoLang unlike other languages
* new() and make() methods are used to allocate memory
* new() --> Allocate memory but no INIT (not initialized)
		--> you will get a memory address
		--> zeroed storage (which means you cannot put any data initially)
* make()--> Allocate memory but and INIT (initialized)
		--> you will get a memory address
		--> non-zeroed storage (which means you can put any data initially too)
* GC (Garbage Collection) happens automatically
* Anything out of scope becomes nil and will be available for GC


Pointers :

* * is used to define pointers
* & is used as reference of memory location for defined variable
